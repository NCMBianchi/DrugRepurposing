The XGBoost prediction is run on (4) cores with seed (1345).
A (ultralight) parameter optimisation step is performed.
The model with parameters ({'subsample': 0.5, 'reg_lambda': 1, 'reg_alpha': 5, 'n_estimators': 10, 'min_child_weight': 5, 'max_depth': 5, 'learning_rate': 0.1, 'gamma': 0.5, 'colsample_bytree': 0.7}) obtained a (0.9057828365412783) score.
